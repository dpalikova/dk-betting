To ensure clarity and maintainability, I adopted a modular approach to the codebase. This structure facilitates ease of understanding and scalability. The project utilizes Vite, chosen for its high-performance build process and rapid development environment.

For responsiveness, I adhered strictly to the specifications outlined in the Mockup-Screens section of the provided Figma design. The implemented breakpoints align with the design requirements and are set at 684px, 744px, 1200px, and 1440px, ensuring an optimal user experience across various devices.

Additionally, I integrated Storybook to document and showcase the individual components. This provides a centralized and interactive environment for visualizing and testing reusable UI elements, enhancing both collaboration and development efficiency.
